# Personal Bio Site
This is a longterm project to create a personal website to show off my achievments made during my time with the NSS.  The site started off very rudimentary, but as I became proficient with different languages and techniques, this site was updated to reflect as such in the listed projects and in the general presentation.  

This is currently a work in progress.
