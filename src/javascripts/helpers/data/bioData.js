const bio = `
<p>
  My name is Michael Dotson.  I'm a Florida native that relocated to Nashville in 2009, and I am working towards a career in Web Development.
</p>
<p>
  I originally moved to Nashville to be with my family, and ended up staying for the culture that lies beneath its country music exterior.
  Since moving to Nashville, I have mainly held positions in the Tech Support field with my more recent experience being in Corporate Sales.
  I'm an avid gamer (both Pen & Paper as well as Video) and consider myself quite the cinephile. (I'll be your secret weapon in Trivia!)
</p>
<p>
  As counter intuitive as it may sound, I'm constantly looking to be challanged in my day to day.
  My most recent career experiences have left me both bored with the predictability and disheartened with the infrequent use of my problem solving skills.
</p>
<p>
  It was through various social events that I first learned of the Nashville Software School and heard the praises sung of it by both friends and aquaintances that attended classes at the campus.<br>
  But it wasn't until one random evening in late 2019 that I finally listened to my friends and began looking towards a career change and going into Web Development.
</p>
<p>
  On advice from my social circles, I began studding alone at home by teaching myself the very basics of Python.<br>
  However, it didn't take me long to realize that the grounded structure and guidance that NSS has to offer would be the best course of action.
</p>
<p>
  A Web Dev career offers the daily challange and problem solving that I was so sorely missing in my day to day.  With the constant developments and changes within the field,
  it also calls for a constant state of learning and flexibility; which is also a much desired change.
  The everchanging nature of the field truly excites me about a career in Web Development.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to the new expeirences and opportunities that lie ahead!
